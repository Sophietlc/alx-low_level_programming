# More pointers, arrays, and strings

## Requirements
* Language: C89
* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
* Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for Holberton School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
* What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
* What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

## Description of what each file shows:
0. a function that fills memory with a constant byte (memset)
1. a function that copies memory area (memcpy)
2. a function that locates a character in a string (strchr)
3. a function that gets the length of a prefix substring (strspn)
4. a function that searches and returns a pointer to a byte matched in a string (strpbrk)
5. a function that locates a substring (strstr)
7. a function that prints the chessboard
8. a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers
9. a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char
10. a file that contains the password for the [crackme2 executable] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x06.c)
    - file should contain the exact password, no new line, no extra space
    - ltrace, ldd, gdb and objdump can help
    - install the openssl library to run the crackme2 program: `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`
