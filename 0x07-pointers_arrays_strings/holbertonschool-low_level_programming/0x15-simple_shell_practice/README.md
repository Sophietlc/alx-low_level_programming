## CREATING A SIMPLE SHELL
> Each file in this repository holds some code that creating a simple Unix shell would use.
> There are more concepts and code that a simple shell would need. This repository
> is purely a playground for my practice and playing purposes before
> I create my actual simple shell. Visit the final product that I created with my partner at
> my repository titled "simple_shell" and our blog post linked there.
