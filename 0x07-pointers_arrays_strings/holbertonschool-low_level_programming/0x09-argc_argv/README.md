## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for Holberton School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## Description of what each file shows:
0. a program that prints its name
1. a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it
2. a program that prints all arguments it receives
3. a program that multiplies two numbers
4. a program that adds positive numbers
100. a program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money
